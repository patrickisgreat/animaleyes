"""Cascade detector: a free local YOLO gate that only escalates to Claude when needed.

YOLO (local, $0) decides dog / cat / nothing on every check. We only pay for a Claude call
when a *dog* is actually at the bowl — the one case that needs real discrimination (Grrr vs
Bowie, and catching a cat that YOLO misread as a small dog). A cat or an empty scene is
handled locally for free. In practice Claude runs only while a dog is in view (a handful of
checks per visit) instead of on every motion, cutting cost while keeping Claude's accuracy.

The gate can be blind: with the camera tight on the feeder, a dog filling the frame (or half
out of it) often isn't recognised as a "dog" at all, and the visit used to go unanswered for
minutes. So when the gate sees nothing, Claude still gets a look every CASCADE_PROBE_S while
motion lasts, and once Claude has seen an animal the gate missed it keeps answering for
CASCADE_STICKY_S so the confirmation streak isn't broken by the gate's "nothing".

Every confident Claude dog verdict also saves the judged frame to data/training/<animal>/,
pre-labelled, so a classifier that eventually replaces Claude trains itself from real IR frames.
