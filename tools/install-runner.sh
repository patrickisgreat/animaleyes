# Install the GitHub Actions self-hosted runner that deploys animaleyes on this box.
#
# The box already runs robot-computer's runner in ~/actions-runner. Runners on a personal
# account belong to one repo, so animaleyes needs its own: separate directory, separate
# systemd service, label `animaleyes`. The two never pick up each other's jobs.
#
# Outbound only (it long-polls GitHub): no port, no firewall change. It runs as the invoking
# user, who must be able to run docker without sudo, because deploying means
# `docker compose up -d --build` in the live checkout.
#
# With gh installed and logged in, this fetches the short-lived registration token itself:
#
#   tools/install-runner.sh
#
# Otherwise pass one from
# https://github.com/patrickisgreat/animaleyes/settings/actions/runners/new
#
#   tools/install-runner.sh <registration-token>
#
# Safety note: .github/workflows/deploy.yml runs on CI success for pushes to main and on
# manual dispatch, never on `pull_request`. Keep it that way: a self-hosted runner runs the
# workflow from the triggering ref, and this box holds the feeder login and the camera.
